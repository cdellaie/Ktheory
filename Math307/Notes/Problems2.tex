\begin{Pb}
Show that the following sets are vector spaces. Hint: show that they are subspaces of well known vector spaces.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \[S= \{\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} \text{ such that } 2x+3y+4z = 0\}\]
\item the set $F$ of symmetric matrices of size $n$, i.e. the set of $A\in M_{n}(\R)$ such that $A = A^T$,
\item the set $G$ of continuous real functions $f: [0,1]\rightarrow \R$ such that $f(0)=0$,
\item the set $H$ of twice differentiable functions $f: \R\rightarrow \R$ such that \[\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} =0,\]
\item for a fixed matrix $A\in M_{m,n}(\R)$, the set $ker(A)$ of vectors $x\in \R^n$ such that $Ax= 0$. This vector space $ker(A)$ is called the kernel of $A$. 
\end{enumerate} 
Find a basis for every spaces, and deduce their dimension. Justify your answer.

\begin{Pb}
Let  \[ V = \{ \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}\in \R^3 \text{ s.t. } x+y+z =0\}.\]

\begin{Pb}
Give a basis for the image and kernel of the following matrices. Solve the associated linear systems.

\begin{Pb}
Find all the polynomials of degree at most $2$ that satisfy the differential equation
\[(x^2+1)p''(x) -xp'(x) +2p(x) = q(x),\]
where $q$ is an arbitrary fixed polynomial.
