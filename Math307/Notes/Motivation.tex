\section*{Motivations}

These are the notes of Math 307, taught at University of Hawaii at Manoa, during Spring 2017. \\

Examples of differential equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Free fall with air resistance
\[mv' = mg - \alpha v\]
\item Pendulum equation
\[\theta'' + \frac{g}{L} sin(\theta ) = 0\]
and its linearization
\[\theta'' + \frac{g}{L} \theta = 0\]
for small oscillations,
\item Population growth: exponential growth $P' = rP $, logistic growth
\[ P' = r(1-\frac{P}{K})P\]
and Lotka-Volterra
\[\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
x' & = & a x - b xy \\
y' & = & d xy - cy
\end{array}\right.\]
\end{itemize}
