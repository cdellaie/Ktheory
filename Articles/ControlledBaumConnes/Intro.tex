\section{Introduction}

Let $X$ be a countable discrete metric space with bounded geometry, i.e. such that, for every $R>0$, 
\[\sup_{x\in X} |B(x,R)|<\infty.\] 
Let $H$ be the separable Hilbert space and 
\[C_R[X] = \{T\in \mathcal L(H\otimes l^2(X)) \text{ s.t. } T_{xy} \in \mathfrak K(H) \text{ and } prop(T) < R \}\]
where $prop(T) = \sup\{d(x,y) \text{ s.t. } T_{xy} \neq 0\}$. Recall that the Roe algebra of $X$ is the $C^*$-algebra defined by
\[C^*(X) = \overline{\cup_{R>0} C_R[X]}\quad ,\] 
where the closure is taken under the operator norm. The coarse Baum-Connes conjecture asserts that
\[\mu_X : \varinjlim KK(C_0(P_d(X),\C) \rightarrow K(C^*(X))\]
is an isomorphism, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $KK(A,B)$ denotes the operator $KK$-theory of G. Kasparov,
\item[$\bullet$] $K(B)$ denotes the operator $K$-theory of the $C^*$-algebra $B$,
\item[$\bullet$] $P_d(X)$ is the Rips complex of $X$.
\end{itemize}

The main application of the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture is the Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of the higher signatures. More precisely, let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group endowed with any left-invariant metric. Such a metric is unique up to quasi-isometry, and let us denote by $|\Gamma|$ the coarse class of the underlying metric space. Denote by $B \Gamma$ the classifying space of $\Gamma$, by $[M]\in H_{dim(M)}(M,\mathbb Q)$ the fundamental class of $M$ and by $\mathcal L_M$ the $L$-class of $M$.

\begin{thm}[Descent principle]
If $\mu_{|\Gamma|}$ is an isomorphism, then the Novikov conjecture holds for $\Gamma$, i.e. for any $x\in H^*(B\Gamma,\mathbb Q)$, any map $f:M\rightarrow B  \Gamma $, the higher signature
\[ \sigma(M,f) = \langle \mathcal L_M\cup f^*(x) ,[M]\rangle\]
is homotopy invariant.
\end{thm}  

In \cite{Yu1}, G. Yu proved that if $X$ is of finite asymptotic dimension, then the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for $X$. More generally, G. Yu proved the following theorem.

\begin{thm}[G. Yu \cite{Yu2}]
If $X$ has property $A$, then the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for $X$.
\end{thm}

As property $A$ is implied by finite asymptotic dimension, the last theorem is more powerful. Still, the two results are quite different in their proofs. Whereas property $A$ entails the existence of so called Dirac and Dual-Dirac elements in $KK$-theory, yielding the result, the proof in the setting of finite asymptotic dimension relies on a analog of Mayer-Vietoris decompositions on the Roe algebras. This proof is more geometric in nature, and more elementary. Quantitative $K$-theory was introduced in \cite{OY2} by H. Oyono-Oyono and G. Yu in order to broaden the domain of validity of this strategy.\\ 

In the author's thesis was introduced controlled $K$-theory. This slight generalization relies on a new definition of filtered $C^*$-algebras, which allows to treat more examples of $C^*$-algebras with the controlled $K$-theory. We define controlled assembly maps in the setting of Roe algebras and of crossed products of $C^*$-algebras by étale groupoids. These assembly maps take values in the controlled $K$-theory, and should enjoy more stability properties than the usual assembly maps. The latter is the object of future work. \\

The controlled assembly maps induces the assembly maps in $K$-theory. We study in more details this phenomenon, which gives what we call quantiative statements (theorems \ref{Quant1},\ref{Quant2} \& \ref{UniformQS}). These theorems relate the classical Baum-Connes conjecture for an étale groupoid to its controlled analog. As a byproduct, we prove in lemma \ref{prod} an interesting result on the $K$-homology of a finite $G$-simplicial complex with values in an infinite product of stable $C^*$-algebras.\\

Following the route of \cite{SkTuYu}, we show that these controlled assembly maps are related by the coarse groupoid defined by G. Skandalis, J-L. Tu and G. Yu. More precisely, out of any coarse space $X$, one can construct an étale groupoid $G(X) \rightrightarrows \beta X$, such that the coarse assembly map $\mu_{X,B}$ is equivalent to the assembly map

\[\mu_{G(X),l^\infty_B} : \varinjlim KK(C_0(P_E(G),B) \rightarrow K(l^\infty_B\rtimes_r G(X))\]
where :
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $\beta X$ is the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of $X$,
\item[$\bullet$] the inductive limit is taken over the compact subsets $E\subseteq G$,
\item[$\bullet$] $l^\infty_B$ is the $G(X)$-algebra $l^\infty (X,B\otimes \mathfrak K)$ and $l^\infty_B\rtimes_r G(X)$ is the associated reduced crossed product,
\item[$\bullet$] $P_E(G)$ is the Rips complex of $G$.
\end{itemize}
These results are implied by their analog in controlled $K$-theory that we prove (theorem \ref{BCCeq}). As a corollary, we prove that any coarse space which admits a fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space satisfies the controlled maximal coarse Baum-Connes conjecture (theorem \ref{fibred}). This is a stronger version of a result of M. Finn-Sell \cite{FinnSellFibred}. Recall that the notion of fibred embedding into Hilbert space is weaker than embedding into Hilbert space. For instance, some box spaces of $SL(2,\Z)$ are expanders, hence cannot embed into Hilbert space, but admits a fibred embedding.\\ 

The article follows the following plan. The second section present an overview of controlled $K$-theory in the setting of $C^*$-algebras filtered by what we call a coarse structure. In the third and fourth sections, we build assembly maps with values in these controlled $K$-groups, which factorizes the usual assembly maps, in the case of étale groupoids and coarse spaces respectively. The last section is devoted to applications of these results in Coarse Geometry.
%We also quickly show how controlled $K$-theory can be used for $K$-amenability of crossed products by discrete quantum groups.  

\subsection{Preliminaries}

We give a short review of the crossed product construction for étale groupoids. If $p : Y_0\rightarrow X$ and $q : Y_1\rightarrow X$ are two fibrations, we denote by $Y_0\times_{p,q} Y_1 = \{(y,y')\in Y_0\times Y_1 \text{ s.t. } p(y)=q(y')\}$ their fibred product. The non-commutative anologue of fibration are given by $C(X)$-algebras. 

\begin{definition}
A $C(X)$-algebra is given by a $C^*$-algebra $A$ and a non-degenerate $*$-homomorphism $\theta : C_0(X) \rightarrow Z(\mathcal M(A))$, where $\mathcal M(A)$ is the $C^*$-algebra of multipliers of $A$.
\end{definition}

If $(A,\theta)$ is a $C(X)$-algebra and $x\in X$, then the fiber over $X$ is defined as $A_x : = A/ \text{ker }(ev_x)A$. Two $C(X)$-algebras have a balanced tensor product $A\otimes_{C(X)} A'$, such that $(A\otimes_{C(X)} A')_x \cong A_x\otimes A'_x$. Notice that in the case of fibration, we get $C_0(Y_0\times_{p,q}Y_1) \cong C_0(Y_0)\times_{C(X)}C_0(Y_1)$. If $f:X_0 \rightarrow X_1$ is a continuous map, and $A$ is a $C(X_1)$-algebra, $f^* A :=C(X_0)\otimes_{C(X_1)} A$ is naturally a $C(X_0)$-algebra, called the pull-back of $A$ along $f$. For details in $C(X)$-algebras, the reader can consult \cite{blanchard} for instance.

Recall the following definition.

\begin{definition}
An étale groupoid is given by two topological spaces, the space of arrows $G$ and the space of units $G^{(0)}$ endowed with:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] continuous maps $s,r : G \rightrightarrows G^{(0)}$ which are local homeomorphisms,
\item[$\bullet$] a topological embedding $e: G^{(0)}\rightarrow G$ called the unit map, and a continuous involution $inv : G\rightarrow G; g\mapsto g^{-1}$ called the inverse map,
\item[$\bullet$] a multiplication map $G\times_{s,r}G\rightarrow G; (g,g')\mapsto gg'$ such that $(gg')g'' = g(g'g'')$, $gg^{-1}= e_{r(g)}$, $g^{-1}g= e_{s(g)}$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

If $A$ is a $C(G^{(0)})$-algebra, an action of the groupoid $G$ is a isomorphism of $C(G)$-algebras $\alpha : s^* A \rightarrow r^* A$ such that $\alpha_g \circ \alpha_{g'} = \alpha_{gg'}$ for every $(g,g')\in G\times_{s,r} G$. Then, define the space of continuous sections with compact support 
\[C_c(G,A) = \bigcup_{U} C_0(U)\otimes_s A\]
where $U$ runs along all open relatively compact subsets of $G$. Here $C_0(U)\otimes_s A$ denotes $C_0(U)\otimes_{C(G^{(0)})} A$, where $s$ in subscript implies that the $C(G^{(0)})$-algebra structure on $C_0(U)$ is given by $s$.\\

Endowing compact sections with convolution
\[(f_0\ast f_1)(g) = \sum_{h\in G^{r(g)}} f_0(h) \alpha_h(f_1(h^{-1}g)).\]
and involution $\overline f(g)=\alpha_g(f(g^{-1})^*)$ for every $f_0,f_1\in C_c(G,A)$, we get a $*$-algebra. 

The $A$-Hilbert module $L^2(G,A)$ is the completion of $C_c(G,A)$ under the scalar product 
\[\langle \xi ,\eta \rangle_x  = \sum_{g\in G^x} \xi(g)\overline \eta(g) \quad x\in G^{(0)} \]
and $C_c(G,A)$ is represented on $L^2(G,A)$ by $\lambda(f) \xi = f\ast \xi$, for every $ f\in C_c(G,A)$ and $\xi\in L^2(G,A)$.\\

\begin{definition}
The reduced crossed product $A\rtimes_r G$ is the $C^*$-algebra obtined by completion of $C_c(G,A)$ under the norm $||f||_r=||\lambda(f)||$.
\end{definition}

In the following section is presented the setting of controlled $K$-theory. The main example is that the set $\mathcal E$ of compact subsets of $G$ defines a coarse structure, and that $A\rtimes_r G$ is $\mathcal E$-filtered, thus allowing to apply the controlled machinery to crossed product of groupoids.
