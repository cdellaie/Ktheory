\section{The controlled category}

Let $\mathcal E$ be a coarse structure. It is a monoidal category, where the objects of $\mathcal E$ are elements of $\mathcal E$ and there is one morphism $E\rightarrow E'$ iff $E\leq E'$.\\

\begin{definition}
Let $\mathcal C$ be a category. The $\mathcal E$-controlled category $\mathcal C_{\mathcal E}$ is defined as the category \begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] whose objects are functors
\[\mathcal O : \tilde{\mathcal  E} \rightarrow \mathcal C,\]
also called $\mathcal E$-controlled objects,
\item[$\bullet$] whose morphisms are natural transformations
\[ F : \mathcal O \rightarrow \mathcal O'\circ \rho\]
where $\mathcal O,\mathcal O'$ are controlled objects and $\rho$ is a control pair.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Let $Grab$ be the category whose objects are abelian groups and whose morphisms are group homomorphisms.
