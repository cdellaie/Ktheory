\section{Quantitative products}

Let $\mathcal A=\{ A_i \}_{i\in I}$ be a family of $C^*$-algebras. We will denote by $l^\infty (\mathcal A)$ the $C^*$-algebra $\prod_{i\in I} A_i$. If the family is constant, $A_i=A$, we just write $l^\infty (A)$, and if not precised, $I $ is supposed to be countable. We denote by $c_0(\mathcal A)$ (resp. $c_0(A)$) the two-sided closed ideal $\bigoplus_I A_i$.\\

Let $A$ be a filtered $C^*$-algebra. The quantitative product $\hat l^\infty(A)$ is the sub-$C^*$-algebra of $l^\infty(A)$ given by the norm closure of  
\[ \cup_r \prod_{n\in \N} A_r. \]
We see $A$ as a subalgebra of $\hat l^\infty (A)$ by the constant embedding.\\

Let $\mathcal B =\{ B_n \}_{n\in \N}$ be a family of sub-$C^*$-algebras (operator spaces?) of $A$. The $r$-neighborhood of $B$ is defined as $N_r(B)=A_r B A_r$. Let $\hat l^\infty (\mathcal B)$ be the closure of
\[\cup_r \prod_{n\in\N} N_r(B_n) \cap A_r. \]
It is then easy to see that $\hat l^\infty (\mathcal B)$ is an ideal in $\hat l^\infty (A)$, even if it might not be proper. This construction will help building ideals out of \textit{approximate ideals}.\\

Let $X$ be a countable discrete coarse space with asymptotic dimension $1$. Pick a sequence $(r_n)$ of positive numbers that diverges to $+\infty$. For each $r_n>0$, let 
\[X = U_n \cup V_n\]
be a decomposition into two subspaces, each one being a $r_n$-disjoint union of uniformly bounded subspaces (of diameter less than $s_n$). Let $B_n$ (resp. $C_N$) be the algebra of bounded operators of $l^2 X$ supported on $U_n\times U_n$ (resp. $V_n\times V_n$). Denote by $I$ and $J$ the ideals $\hat l^\infty (\mathcal B)$ and $\hat l^\infty (\mathcal C)$ respectively. Then $I+J = ?$\\

Same thing for groupoids with dynamical asymptotic dimension $1$.\\

Let $A$ be a separable $C^*$-algebra with nuclear dimension $1$.
