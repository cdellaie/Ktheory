\begin{abstract}
This article presents a proof of the Künneth formula in operator $K$-theory for crossed-products of $C^*$-algebras by a particular class of \'etale groupoids. This result uses the Going Down Principle developed by J. Chabert, S. Echterhoff and H. Oyono-Oyono in \cite{ChabertEOY} in the setting of locally compact groups. In order to extend it to the setting of \'etale groupoids, we have to define and study induction and restriction in the context of equivariant $KK$-theory, which in itself offers interesting results. The author could only define induction in the case of an open subgroupoid, thus motivating the introduction of a class of groupoids whose proper actions are all locally induced by compact open subgroupoids. This condition, even if satisfied by a large class of examples (ample groupoids for instance), remains mysterious, and might be weakened in future work.
