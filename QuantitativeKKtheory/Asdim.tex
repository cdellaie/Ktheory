\section{Asymptotic dimension}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a metric space. \\
The multiplicity of a cover $\mathcal U$ of $X$ is the largest number $n\in \mathbb N$ such that every point $x\in X$ is contained in at most $n$ elements of $\mathcal U$.\\
If $R>0$, the $R$-multiplicity is the defined as the multiplicity restricted on covers uniformly bounded by $R$.\\
The asymptotic dimension of $x$ is the smallest natural integer $n\in \mathbb N$ such that, for all $R>0$, there exists a uniformly bounded cover $\{U_j\}$ with $R$-multiplicity $n+1$.\\
Such a space is said to have finite asymptotic dimension if this number, denoted $\text{dim}_\infty X$, is bounded.\\
