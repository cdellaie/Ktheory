\section{Groupoid as local symmetries}

A bit of culture. Groupoid as generalized spaces: Moerdjik, foliations, localic groupoids and Galois correspondence. Fundamental groupoid. Lie groupoids. Alain Connes' story about Heisenberg's discovery on Heligoland Island (maybe this fits more in $C^*$-algebras.\\

Actions of groupoids. $R[G]$ and $M[X]$.\\

Groupoid of germs of an action by partial homeomorphisms. (Local symmetries)

\section{Coarse groupoid}

\[G(X) = \cup \overline E \subset \beta (X\times X )\]

also description of $G_w$ using the limit spaces, and examples \[X\times X \coprod \partial\beta X \rtimes G\] in the case of a group and a box space.

Groupoid of germs of the action of partial translations on the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification.

\section{Haagerup's property}

\begin{thm} Let $X$ be a coarse metric space with bounded geometry.
Then $X$ admits a CEH iff $G(X)$ is a-T-menable.
\end{thm}  

Same for property A and amenablity?

\begin{prop}
If one has a positive definite type kernel, equivariant wrt a subgroupoid $N$, one can build a $G$-space $X$ , compact and metrizable, such that $X\rtimes N$ is a-T-menable.
\end{prop}
