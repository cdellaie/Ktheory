\subsection{Limits spaces}

$X(\omega)$ \\

In the case of a group, a box space.
\[X(\omega) = |G| \]

\section{Infinite dimensional spaces}

Focus on Hilbert spaces. Equip the Hilbert space with the weak topology. The closed balls are then compact (Banach Alaoglu) Interesting applications?\\

Other interesting examples: spaces of probability measures, of repartition functions. Gauge fields theory = moduli space of connections on $G$-principal bundles.

\section{Coarse embeddings into Hilbert spaces}

When does a metric space coarsely embeds into a Hilbert space? When the distance function gives a negative type kernel.\\

Theory of kernels. Maybe RKHS and applications in statistics. Preparation for a-t-menability and equivariant coarse embedding. Setting: $G$ acts on $X$ metric, then $X$ CEH $G$-equivariantly iff there exists a $G$-invariant kernel. For $X= |G|$, we say a-T-menable. \\

Consequence: $\oplus_t GNS(\phi_t)$ representation always have almost invariant vectors and no invariant vectors when $G$ is infinite, so that property T prevents aTmenablity. Talk about the link between kernel and representations for groups, metric spaces and $*$-algebras.\\

What if a group is CEH? Then the exist $X$ compact metrizable such that $X\rtimes G$ is aTmenable. Moreover $X\times R_+$ endowed with the ``Skandalis'' topology is a model for $\underline E G $.

Examples\\

Expanders do not coarsely embed. Example: box spaces of property $\tau$ ((T) is enough). Example $SL(2,\Z)$ admits an expander box spaces. But does not have property (T) Problem?\\

Talk a little bit about nuclearity.

\section{Problems}

Draw the Cayley graphs of $\Z$, $PSL(2,\Z)$, $\Z / (n) \ast \Z / (m)$ and Heisenberg.\\

Use a software to get the first Caykey graphs of $PSL(2,\Z_p)$.\\

Show Milnor Svarc lemma.\\

Reproducing kernels.\\

Show that all metric spaces are embeddable into a Banach space. ($x\mapsto d(x, *), X\rightarrow l^\infty (X)$)
