\section{Exact sequences}

Exact sequences: in the case of completions of $*$-algebra, underline that it is a statement on the norms.\\

Commutative, Nuclear, Exact.\\

\section{Roe algebras}

\section{Groupoid algebras}

Completions of $\C[G]$.

\section{Tensor products}

\section{Crossed products constuctions}

Twisted tensor products.

\section{Some theorems}
\begin{thm}
[Tu] If $G$ is a-T-menable then $C^*_r(G)$ is Bootstrap.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
If $G$ is a infinite hyperbolic group with property T, $C^*_r(G)$ is not $K$-nuclear.
\end{thm}

If $G$ is a-T-menable, the trivial and regular representations are homotopic. This cannot happen in the case of property T.\\

\subsection{Classification}

Some results without proofs.

\section{Problems}

Classify the finite dimesional $C^*$-algebras using the GNS representations.\\

Classify the AF algebras.\\

Describe the $C^*$-algebra of a finite/compact group. Example: finite permutations groups, SU(2).
