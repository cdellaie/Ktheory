\section{Property (T) and its friends}

Laplacian and projections.\\
If $X$ is a box space of a property tau group $G$,
\[\Delta = \sum_S (s-1)^*(s-1) \in \C [G] \subset \C[X]\]
and failure of 
\[ 0 \rightarrow c_0(X)\rtimes_r G \rightarrow C^*_u(X) \rightarrow \partial l^\infty (X)\rtimes_r G \rightarrow 0\]
to be exact.


\section{Extensions of $C^*$-algebras}

$A$ is a separable $C^*$-algebra.

\begin{definition}
An essential extension of $A$ by $\mathfrak K(H)$ is a short exact sequence
\[0 \rightarrow \mathfrak K(H) \rightarrow E \rightarrow A \rightarrow 0\] where
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $E$ is a unital $C^*$-algebra,
\item[$\bullet$] the image of $\mathfrak K(H)$ is an essential ideal of $E$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Busby invariants $\tau: A \rightarrow Q(H)$ and 
\[Ext(A) \cong Mor(A,Q(H)) / \sim_U\]

Additive structure.\\

Voiculescu's thm: all trivial exensions give rise to the same element. Let $0\in Ext(A)$ be the class of any of these trivial extensions, then $0$ is an neutral element for $\oplus$.\\

Invertible elements corresponds to liftable maps, i.e. there exists a ucp lift of the Busby invariant. (Uses Stinespring dilation)\\ 

Arveson's thm: if $A$ is nuclear, $Ext(A)$ is a group.\\

If $G$ is an infinite property (T) group, then there are at most countably many inequivalent classes of f.d. irreducible representations. Let $J$ be the ideal generated by the Kazdhan projections (on the isotypical components) in $C^*_{max}(G)$, then the $*$-morphism
\[\oplus \pi_k : C^*_{max}(G) \rightarrow \bigoplus B(H_k) \subset B(H)\]
factorizes to give $\phi: C^*(G)/J \rightarrow Q(H)$, and the natural inclusion $im(\phi) \hookrightarrow Q(H)$ is not liftable. As a consequence, $Ext$ need not be a group.\\

Maybe do directly the case of $G$-algebras, and use Kasparov's paper on Stinespring and Voiculescu's theorems.\\

\section{Exactness}
\begin{thm}
$G$ is exact iff $C^*_r(G)$ is exact \\
iff $C^*_u(G)$ is nuclear \\
iff $\beta G \rtimes G$ is amenable \\
iff $0\rightarrow \mathfrak K(l^2G) \rightarrow C^*_u(G) \rightarrow C(\partial \beta G )\rtimes_r G \rightarrow  0 $ is exact \\
iff $A\mapsto A\rtimes_r G$ is exact.\\
\end{thm}
Does there exists $X$ such that $C^*_u(X)$ is nuclear and $0\rightarrow \mathfrak K(l^2X) \rightarrow C^*_u(X) \rightarrow C(\partial \beta X )\rtimes_r G(X) \rightarrow  0 $ is not exact? Partial answer by Rufus, for a well chosen Higson-Roe groupoid $G_{\mathcal N} = \coprod_i G_i \cup_{\infty} G$, the sequence 
\[0\rightarrow \mathfrak \bigoplus C^*_r(G_i) \rightarrow C^*_r(G_{\mathcal N}) \rightarrow C^*_r (G) \rightarrow  0 \]
fails to be exact.
