\section{Notations}

In this paper, $G$ will in general denote a topological groupoid, locally compact $\sigma$-compact, $A,B,D$ will be reserved for $C^*$-algebres or $G$-algebras.\\

$H$ is the separable Hilbert space. If $B$ is a $C^*$-algebra, $H_B$ is the standard right Hilbert module over $B$, i.e. \[H_B= H\otimes B=\{(b_j)\in B^\N \text{ s.t. }\sum b_j^* b_j \text{ converges in B}\}\] with the inner product $\langle b, b'\rangle = \sum b_j^* b_j'$. For any right $B$-Hilbert module $E$, $\mathcal L_B(E)$ is the $C^*$-algebra of adjoinable operators and $\mathfrak K_B(E)$ the $C^*$-algebra of compact operators of $E$ in the sense of Hilbert modules.\\

We will use the equivariant $KK$-theory of Le Gall, which are $\Z_2$-graded abelian groups $KK^G_*(A,B)$.\\

For any $G$-algebra $A$, $A\rtimes_r G$ denotes the reduced crossed-product of $A$ by $G$, $A\rtimes_{max} G$ the maximal one.
