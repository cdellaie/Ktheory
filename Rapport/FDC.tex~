\section{Decomposition complexity}

Let $G$ be an étale groupoid with a proper length $l$. Fix $s>0$, and $G_s=\{g\in G : l^{r(g)}(g)\leq s\}$. For each subset $U$ of $X$, we can define the $s$-neiborghood of $U$ :
\[U_s = \{x\in X : \exists g\in G_s \text{ s.t. } r(g)\in U \text{ and } s(g)=x \}\]

\begin{definition}
Let $G$ be an étale groupoid with compact base space $X$, and $\mathcal F$ a family of groupoids . We say that $G$ decomposes over $\mathcal F$ if, for every $R>0$, there exists a decomposition $X=X^{(1)}\cup X^{(2)}$ into subspaces such that each subspace $X^{(i)}$ is a disjoint union $\sqcup_j X^{(i)}_j$ satisfying the following conditions :
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] if $j\neq j'$,  $X^{(i)}_{j,R}\cap X^{(i)}_{j'}=\varnothing$
\item[$\bullet$] there exists $s>0$ such that for every $i,j$, the groupoid $G_{j,s}^{(i)}$ generated by $G_{|X^{(i)}_j}\cap G_s$ is relatively compact and is in $\mathcal F$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\textbf{Motivating example.}\\
Let $G=G(X)$ the coarse groupoid associated to a uniformly discrete metric space $X$ with bounded geometry. Then $G$ has FDC iff $X$ has FDC.\\
