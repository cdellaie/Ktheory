\section{Introduction}

This section is devoted to summarize the extent my work at the end of the second year of my PhD.\\

The aim of my subject is to study relationship between several worlds : coarse geometry, groupoids and $C^*$-algebras. The idea is to transfer ideas that were very profitable to coarse geometry into groupoids, and to try and exploit them to compute $K$-theory groups of certain groupoids. More precisely, we will consider several functors between categories which we will define later.

\[\begin{tikzcd}
\  & \textbf{Coarse} \quad (X,\mathcal E) \arrow[bend left]{dr}{G(X)} \arrow[bend right]{dl}{\beta X} \arrow{dd}{C^*X,C^*_uX}& \ \\
 \textbf{Top} \quad (Z,\mathcal T) \arrow[bend right]{dr}{C_0(Z)} & \  & \textbf{Grpds}\quad G \arrow[bend left]{dl}{C^*_r G} \\
 \ & \textbf{C}^* \quad A \arrow{d} & \ \\
\ & \text{KK} & \ \\
\end{tikzcd}\]
