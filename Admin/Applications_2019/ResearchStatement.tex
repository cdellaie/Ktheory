\maketitle

I received my PhD form the University of Lorraine in July 2017, under the supervision of Herv\'e Oyono-Oyono and Andrzej Z\.{u}k. I have been in a postdoctoral position at University of \Hawaii  at Manoa since August 2017, under the supervision of Rufus Willett. The website \url{http://math.hawaii.edu/~dellaiera/} contains all my preprints, and documents related to my research and teaching activities.\\ 

The rest of this document is devoted to a presentation of my research. I divided the piece into two parts: we first give an overview of \textit{Operator algebras} and \textit{Noncommutative Geometry} which is intended to be accessible to the non-specialist. I then move on to a more specific description of my work and projects. These are of course what I am focusing at the moment, and hopefully future encounters and experiences will broaden this list.
