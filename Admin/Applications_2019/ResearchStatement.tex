\maketitle

This document describes the future directions that I will be trying to study in the next years. I am also interested in any other project which would lead to fruitful collaborations. The piece is divided into two parts: a general introduction focusing on ideas and motivations for my main field of study, followed by a succession of research projects and questions, oriented towards a reader more aware of Operator Algebras and Noncommutative Geometry.
