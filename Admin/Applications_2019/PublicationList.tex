\item \textit{Topological property T for groupoids}, with Rufus Willett. Preprint on the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07085}{arxiv}, november 2018. Submitted for publication.\\

Property (T) is a representation theoretic notion for topological groups, introduced by Kazdhan \cite{kazhdan1967connection} in 1967 in order to show that some lattices in some Lie groups are finitely generated. In a rather unexpected manner, such a particular goal gave one of the most fruitful notions, with applications ranging from pure to applied mathematics. Property (T) has been used intensively in representation theory and operator algebras, one of the most spectacular applications being the first non probabilistic proof of the existence of expander graphs by Margulis. To us, the main fact of interest is the equivalence between property (T) and the existence of a  very exotic projection in the maximal $C^*$-algebra of the group, called the \textit{Kazdhan projection}. This projection makes various short sequences of $C^*$-algebras not exact, leading to a failure, in some cases, of the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients. Trying to adapt these construction to the metric setting, Willett and Yu define in \cite{WillettYu} the \textit{Geometric Property (T)} for metric spaces with bounded geometry and carefully study its link with the Coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the approximation properties of Roe algebras.\\

To a metric space with bounded geometry $X$ one can associate an ample groupoid $G(X)$ such that  $C^*_u(X)$ and $C_r^*(G(X))$ are naturally isomorphic with intertwined assembly maps. This suggest that one can define a version of property (T) for groupoids which generlizes both usual property (T) for groups and its geometric version. This is what we did, defining the concept of \textit{topological property (T)} for groupoids. After proving that topological property (T) indeed generalizes former similar notions, we study its relation to a-T-menability and also apply it to different situations. We prove for instance that property $(\tau)$ (a notion related to expander graphs) for residually finite groups is equivalent to a certain groupoid having topological property (T). In the last part, we give a condition ensuring that a property (T) groupoid is not inner-exact in $K$-theory. This is a strong property, giving obstructions to the Baum-Connes conjecture, studied at the end of the paper.
