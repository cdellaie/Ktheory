This document describes in a first section 
the work done under the supervision of Hervé Oyono-Oyono during my PhD thesis in Metz, at the Elie Cartan’s Institute of Lorraine.
, and then 
presents my research project. 
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Lorraine, and I am beginning my third year of PhD. I am supposed to defend my PhD thesis before June 2017. My work should be submitted within several weeks, and I am very happy to send the preprint version of my work to anyone who is interested in having more details. \\
