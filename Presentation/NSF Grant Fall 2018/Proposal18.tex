\section{Broader impacts of current proposal}
  
The author has been at the mathematics department at the University of \Hawaii~ at \Manoa~ since fall 2017.\\  

PI is involved in the training of graduate students, and will continue to be so. Together with Erik Guentner and Rufus Willett, the PI runs a seminar in noncommutative geometry; this is currently well-attended by graduate students (7 out of the roughly 20 PhD students in our department; 5 out of the 7 are from underrepresented groups). PI Dell'Aiera cannot formally be an advisor to graduate students, but he has already had many informal interactions with graduate students, discussing mathematics with them, and guiding reading, building on his earlier work running seminars as a PhD student.\\

PI Willett has also been involved in giving lecture series at summer schools and other conferences (six over the last three years, the largest to an audience of over a hundred junior operator algebraists), largely aimed at educating junior researchers from other institutions.  He expects this to continue (one more is currently planned for February 2018, for example).  

PI Willett is heavily involved with efforts to improve mathematics education at the University of \Hawaii.  Within his own department, he has been on the graduate committee for the last five years, during which time he played an instrumental role in pushing through changed designed to broaden and modernize students' education, and to decrease time to graduation.  These changes seem successful so far, although have only been implemented for two years.  The graduate committee is currently focused on simplifying the application process for graduate students and making it more attractive, largely to attract more students from non-traditional backgrounds (partly as a goal in itself, partly as this is a good way for our low-ranked department to attract good students).

In the university more broadly, PI Willett chairs the board overseeing foundations general education requirements.  In the last two years, the board has been working on (amongst other things) changing our mathematics general education requirement, designed to better introduce students to the uses of mathematics, and give a sense of it as a dynamic subject.  These changes are currently being implemented: we expect the net effect to be a more mathematically engaged student body, particularly those for whom general education is their only contact to mathematics.  PI Willett has spent a significant amount of time learning about best practices at other universities and mathematics departments as part of this process.  

In terms of connections to other fields, PI Dell'Aiera has some background in physics; %I think --> Yes, but I have no official certification
he has grown more interested in applications of Noncommutative Geometry to other fields during his PhD, and wishes to learn more about its connections with physics and run seminars educating colleagues on this.  As a PhD student, he already did this (on the subject of quantum field theory) for a group of other interested graduate students.  Possible topics include a version of the standard model of particle physics based on noncommutative geometry that  Alain Connes et al developed (see \cite{ChamseddineConnes} for a survey). A second topic could be the surprising appearance of operator $K$-theory in solid state physics to study quasicrystals (see \cite{Bellissard}).  The noncommutative geometry seminar, co-organized by the two PIs and Erik Guentner, will be a natural place to educate the members of the department who are interested, including graduate students.
