\section*{Project Description}

%Cl\'{e}ment Dell'Aiera and Rufus Willett - $K$-theory, groups, and groupoids.\\

In the first section below we discuss results (both intellectual merit and broader impacts) from prior support, in the second section we discuss the intellectual merit of the proposed project, and in the third section we discuss its broader impacts.
 
\section{Results from prior NSF Support}

PI Dell'Aiera has no prior support from the US NSF.

\section{Broader impacts of current proposal}
  
The author has been at the mathematics department at the University of \Hawaii~ at \Manoa~ since fall 2017.\\  

PI is involved in the training of graduate students, and will continue to be so. Together with Erik Guentner and Rufus Willett, the PI runs a seminar in noncommutative geometry; this is currently well-attended by graduate students (7 out of the roughly 20 PhD students in our department; 5 out of the 7 are from underrepresented groups). PI Dell'Aiera cannot formally be an advisor to graduate students, but he has already had many informal interactions with graduate students, discussing mathematics with them, and guiding reading, building on his earlier work running seminars as a PhD student.\\

In terms of connections to other fields, PI Dell'Aiera has some background in physics; %I think --> Yes, but I have no official certification
He has grown more interested in applications of Noncommutative Geometry to other fields during his PhD, and wishes to learn more about its connections with physics and run seminars educating colleagues on this.  As a PhD student, he already did this (on the subject of quantum field theory) for a group of other interested graduate students.  Possible topics include a version of the standard model of particle physics based on noncommutative geometry that  Alain Connes et al developed (see \cite{ChamseddineConnes} for a survey). A second topic could be the surprising appearance of operator $K$-theory in solid state physics to study quasicrystals (see \cite{Bellissard}). The noncommutative geometry seminar, co-organized by the PI Dell'Aiera, Erik Guentner and Rufus Willett, will be a natural place to educate the members of the department who are interested, including graduate students.\\

Concerning communication, PI Dell'Aiera is currently setting up a blog based on the talks done during the noncommutative geometry seminar. It will be encouraged for graduate students (and anyone interested) to write posts accessible to a broad audience, or at least a undergraduate with a good background, based on what was treated during the talks, or anything related to mathematics.\\
