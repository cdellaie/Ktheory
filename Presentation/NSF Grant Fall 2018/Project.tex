\subsection{From approximation properties to the K\"unneth formula in operator $K$-theory and the Universal Coefficient Theorem}

An important part of Operator Algebras as a field can be described as attempting to answer questions arising in Functional Analysis using other seemingly unrelated fields, the most common being Topological Dynamics, Group and Geometric Group theory. A good starting point to understand these preocupations is the work of Alexander Grothendieck on tensor products of topological vector spaces. \\

At the time, starting his PhD in Nancy, Grothendieck was asked by Laurent Schwartz to develop a theory of tensor products for topological vector spaces. This question was motivated by the kernel theorem, whose proof was found to be too much involved by Laurent Schwartz in the general case, whereas the finite dimensional case reduces to the fact that 
\[V^*\otimes W \cong Hom(V,W),\] 
i.e. the space of linear maps is isomorphic as a vector space to the tensor product of the dual of the domain with the codomain. Having topological tensor products in one's toolbox led to hope for a simpler and more natural proof. The rest of the story is well known: Grothendieck found that one could define a lot of topologies on the algebraic tensor products. Spaces admitting only one such completion were called \textit{nucl\'eaires}, or nuclear, after the kernel theorem (\textit{nucl\'eaires} in French means "related to the kernel").\\

The paper \textit{R\'esum\'e de la th\'eorie m\'etrique des produits tensoriels topologiques} \cite{GrothendieckResume}, commonly know as the Resum\'e, enhanced a vast research program. It specified the work to the case of Banach spaces. Surprisingly, the paper did not attract a lot of attention at the time, maybe because the trend was back then to focus on locally convex spaces. The paper was rediscovered in the \textbf{WHEN?}. See \cite{PisierSurvey} for a very nice survey on the subject.\\

Approximation theory for $C^*$-algebras is direclty inspired and derives from this work. The broad idea is to study properties of various constructions such as tensor products or crossed-products (which is a twisted version of tensor products). It is very useful in that case to use functionnal spaces of functions on a topological group as a tool to construct exotic examples. Let me illustrate this by the following example.\\

John Von Neumann defined a property on groups called \textit{amenability} as follows. A discrete countable group $\Gamma$ is said to be amenable if there exists an invariant mean (i.e. linear positive functional) $m: l^\infty(\Gamma)\rightarrow \C$. Now, the group ring $\C[\Gamma]$ is a $*$-algebra w.r.t. the convolution as a product and $(z. \gamma)^* = \overline{z}\gamma^{-1}$. This algebra can be represented as a self adjoint subalgebra of the bounded operators on the complex Hilbert space $l^2\Gamma$ by what is called the left regular representation $\lambda_\Gamma: \C[\Gamma]\rightarrow B(l^2\Gamma)$. The reduced $C^*$-algebra of the group $\Gamma$ is defined as the closure of the image of the regular representation.\\

It turns out that, for such a group $\Gamma$, this $C^*$-algebra is nuclear iff $\Gamma$ is amenable. Thus, examples of nonamenable groups (like any nonabelian free group) provide instances of nonnuclear $C^*$-algebras. This example is typical of how a completely group theoretic property can be used to provide contructions of Banach algebras with interesting properties. Many other areas of mathematics contribute to fuel new ideas in operator algebras. A nice object which is general enough to encompass all of these constructions and provides easily a $C^*$-algebra is a groupoid. Indeed, out of an action by homeomorphisms of a group $\Gamma$ on a topological space $\Omega$ or out of a metric space $X$, one can build groupoids (respectively the action groupoid $\Omega \rtimes \Gamma$ and the coarse groupoid $G(X)$ \cite{SkTuYu}) nice enough to have convolution algebras. \\  
%Amenability was of uttermost importance in the classification of factors obtained by Connes \cite{}. \\

A very interesting game is to take a property in any of these fields, try to define it in the setting of groupoids, and then to unravel the definition in another setting. For instance, amenability can be easily defined to locally compact groupoids \cite{}. But if one looks at the coarse groupoid $G(X)$ of a metric space, saying it is amenable is equivalent to say that $X$ has Yu's property (A). Another direction is to use properties of groupoids to build interesting classes of $C^*$-algebras. For instance, second countable locally compact amenable groupoids have their reduced $C^*$-algebras that are known to satisfy the K\"unneth formula. \\

Over the years, other properties have been found to be of interest. Without pretending to be exhaustive, let us just mention exactness, simplicity, finite nuclear dimension, the UCT class, the Bootstrap class,... Usually (meaning to my knowledge) these classes are important because of their relation to Elliot's classification progam, or to topology and geometry. \\

One of the objects of importance for $C^*$-algebras are the \textit{operator $K$-theory groups} $K_0(A)$ and $K_1(A)$, which are homotopy invariant abelian groups associated to any $C^*$-algebras. Georges Elliott suggested that all separable nuclear $C^*$-algebras should be classifiable by ``$K$-theoretic'' invariants. While seen as unreachable at the time of its statement, Elliott's conjecture cristallised last year as the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{classification}(By many, many hands) All separable simple unital UCT $C^*$-algebras of finite nuclear dimension are classifiable.
\end{theorem}

This result, together with the fact that the $K$-groups are notoriously difficult to compute, give motivations to the following problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item define special families of $C^*$-algebras and prove that they satisfy the condition of the classification theorem \ref{classification},
\item enlarge the range of applicability of theorem \ref{classification},
\item find a way to compute the $K$-theory groups.
\end{enumerate}    

The first two points are very active branches of research right now, and much work has been devoted to find a way to prove that finite nuclear dimension for $C^*$-algebras implies UCT. UCT stands for Universal Coefficients Theorem, and a $C^*$-algebra is said to belong to the UCT class if Kasparov abelian groups $KK_0(A,B)$ and $KK_1(A,B)$ can be computed for every $C^*$-algebras $B$ from the $K$-theory groups of $A$ and $B$. A very similar class is that of $C^*$-algebras that satisfy the K\"unneth formula. \\

On the other hand, the $K$-groups are computable for $C^*$-algebras coming from groups satisfying the Buam-Connes conjecture. In \cite{BCH84}, P. Baum, A. Connes and N. Higson suggested that a certain group homomorphism
\[\mu_G : K_*^{top}(\underline E G) \rightarrow K_*(C_r^*(G)), \]
called the assembly map, is an isomorphism. Here, 
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $\underline E G$ is the classifying space for proper actions of $G$, a CW-complex associated to $G$,
\item[$\bullet$] $K_*^{top}(X)$ is, for every left $G$-space $X$, the \textit{$G$-equivariant analytic $K$-homology} of $X$, a classical homolgy group that can be computed by the traditional means of algebraic topology,
\item[$\bullet$] and of course $K_*(C_r^*(G))$ stands for the $K$-theory groups of the reduced $C^*$-algebra of $G$. 
\end{itemize}

Another reason why computation of $K$-theory groups is so interesting is its link with classical geometry and topology. Indeed, if $G=\pi_1(M)$ is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifolds, the assembly map $\mu_G$ specializes to 
\[\mu_G : K_*(M)\rightarrow K_*(C^*_r(G)).\]
The injectivity of $\mu_G$ proves the Novikov conjecture for $M$, which states the homotopy invariance of higher signatures of $M$. More precisely:

\begin{conjecture} Let $M$ be a smooth oriented closed manifold, 
$[M]\in H_{dim(M)}(M,\mathbb Q)$ its fundamental class and
$ L(M)\in H^{4k}(M,\mathbb Q)$ its $L$-class. Let $\Gamma$ a discrete group and $B\Gamma$ its classifying space. 
For any map $f: M \rightarrow B\Gamma$, define the higher signature 
\[\sigma_x(M,f) = \langle L(M)\cup f^*(x),[M] \rangle \quad \forall x \in H(B\Gamma, \mathbb Q).\]
The Novikov conjecture states that for every orientation preserving homotopy equivalence $\phi : N\rightarrow M$,
\[\sigma_x(M,f)= \sigma_x(N,f\circ \phi).\]
\end{conjecture}

Injectivity of the assembly map has other important consequences. If $M$ is supposed to be a spin manifold, then it implies that $M$ does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature (Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture). surjectivity of $\mu_G$ implies that $C^*_r(G)$ does not contain any non trivial idempotents.\\

We will present several projects that are related to these questions. Namely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item in recent work, the author and Chrisitan B\"onicke have proven that the K\'unneth formula holds for Roe algebras of metric spaces that admit a coarse embedding into Hilbert spaces. This is done by using topological groupoids techniques combined with using the Baum-Connes assembly map. The core of the porrf relies on a stability of the K\"unneth folrmula with respect to a weak type of decomposition of \'etale groupoids, inspired by notions such as asymptotic dimension and finite decomposition complexity in geometric group theory and coarse geometry. \\

\textbf{Question:} Is the Baum-Connes conjecture also stable by this kind of decomposition ?\\

This seems plausible by recent results of H. Oyono-Oyono and G. Yu \cite{OY3}, where they proved the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for groups with finite decomposition complexity. An interesting point is the existence of groupoids that does decompose w.r.t. a family of a-T-menable groupoids but are not themselves a-T-menable. If the question can be answered positively, this would provide new examples of groupoids that satisfies the Baum-Connes conjecture.     

\item The use of \textit{weak decomposition} of groupoids (or of coarse spaces) uses intensively \textit{controlled $K$-theory}, which is a refinement of operator $K$-theory that was developed by Oyono-Oyono and Yu \cite{OY2}. Controlled $K$-theory is defined as a family of groups indexed by two numbers, which when one takes to $0$ and $\infty$ recovers $K$-theory. In the author's thesis, controlled $K$-theory was slightly generalized in order to be applicable to groupoid $C^*$-algebras and quantum groups. The case of quantum groups was surprising and not expected,  

\item Property T
 
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the piece will be to give details and context to these ideas.

\subsection{Quantum groups}

Quantum groups can be thought as \textit{noncommutative locally compact groups} in the same way that $C^*$-algebras can be seen as noncommutative spaces. This means that when the $C^*$-algebra is unital and commutative, it is isomorphic to the algebra of complex continuous functions on a compact group. The basic examples of easiest compact quantum groups are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $C(G)$ for $G$ a compact group, with comultiplication $\Delta(f)(x,y)= f(xy)$ (here $C(G)\otimes C(G)$ is identified with $C(G\times G)$),
\item[$\bullet$] $C^*_r(\Gamma)$ for $\Gamma$ a discrete group, with comultiplication $\Delta(\delta_\gamma)= \delta_\gamma \otimes \delta_\gamma$.\\
\end{itemize}     
The starting point of this project is the realization that the dual of a compact quantum group (which is a discrete quantum group) has a natural filtration in the sense of the previous section. The associated coarse structure is given by the set $\mathcal E$ of symmetric finite dimensional representations of the quantum group. \\

To understand this picture, it is helpful to consider the case of a commutative abelian compact group $G$. For every such representation $\pi\in \mathcal E$, let $C_\pi(G)$ be the closed self-adjoint vector space generated by the coefficients of $\pi$:
\[C_\pi(G)  = Span \{ g \mapsto \langle \pi(g)\xi, \eta\rangle\}_{\xi,\eta\in H}.\]
By Stone-weierstrass theorem, the union of the $C_\pi(G)$ is dense in $C(G)$, which is isomorphic by Fourier transform to the reduced $C^*$-algebra of the Pontryagin dual of $G$, which is an abelian discrete group $\Gamma$. Moreover
\[C_\pi(G)C_\sigma(G) \subseteq C_{\pi \circ\sigma}(G)\]
with $\pi \circ\sigma = \pi \otimes\sigma \oplus \sigma \otimes \pi$, wich defines a structure of semigroup on $\mathcal E$. In short, $C^*(\Gamma)$ is filtered by 
$\mathcal E_G$. This generalizes entirely to discrete quantum groups, and even to crossed product of $C^*$-algebras by action by automorphisms of such things. \\

In the case of the Roe algebra $C^*(X)$, the filtration was given by the \textit{entourages} of $X$. In a sense, the representations of the dual of a discrete quantum group encode its noncommutative coarse geometry. The following projects are an attempt to translate notions of Coarse Geometry into the realm of quantum groups.
