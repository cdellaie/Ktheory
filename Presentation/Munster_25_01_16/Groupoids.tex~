\section{Simple examples for Baum-Connes for groupoids}

This is a question asked by Sayan Chakraborty : find a simple example of the Baum-Connes conjecture for groupoids.\\

The simplest examples would be to take the groupoid associated to an action of a group on a topological space $\mathcal G = X\rtimes G$. The first thing we want to do is to describe the classifying space for proper actions.\\

Suppose the groupoid Ã©tale equipped with a proper length. A simple model, from J-L. Tu \cite{TuBC2}, is given by the inductive limite of the spaces
\[Z_d=\left\{\nu \in \mathcal M(\mathcal G), s.t. \exists x,\text{if } g\in \text{supp }\nu \text{ then } l(g)\leq d , g\in \mathcal G^x\right\}.\]

Indeed, suppose $Y$ is a $\mathcal G$-proper cocompact space, then $Y\rtimes \mathcal G$ is a proper groupoid, so there exists a cutt-off function $c : Y\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that : 
\[\sum_{g\in \mathcal G^{p(y)}} c(yg) = 1,\forall y \in Y.\]
Now define \[y \mapsto \sum_{g\in \mathcal G^{p(y)}} c(yg)\delta_g\]
which is a $\mathcal G$-equivariant continuous map. Moreover $Z_d$ is proper and cocompact, and there exists a $d$ s.t. the map takes its values in it.\\

Now if $\mathcal G = X\rtimes G$, $Z_d \simeq X\times Z'_d$ where $Z_d= \left\{ \nu \in \mathcal M(G), s.t. \text{if } g\in \text{supp }\nu \text{ then } l(g)\leq d\right\}$, so that
$KK^{\mathcal G}(\Delta,A)\simeq KK^G(\Delta', A)$, where $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are respectively the $0$-dimensional part of the equivariant complexes $Z_d$ and $Z'_d$. This is true because the action of $G$ on $Z'_d$ is proper and cocompact, see lemma $3.6$ of \cite{TuBC2}. Now a standard Mayer-Vietoris argument (theorem $3.8$ \cite{TuBC2}) concludes to show that 
$K^{top}(\mathcal G,A)\simeq K^{top}(G,A)$.\\

As $C^*_r \mathcal G = C_0(X)\rtimes_r G$, we see that the Baum-Connes assembly map for $\mathcal G$ with coefficients in $A$ is equivalent to 
\[K_*^{top}(G,A)\rightarrow K_*((A\otimes C_0(X))\rtimes G).\]

Now we can look for concrete examples.
