\section{Seminar}

\subsection{Cartan subalgebras}

Out of any inclusion of $C^*$-algebras $A\subseteq B$ with $A$ unital commutative, we construct an action of the normalizer of $A$ in $B$ by partial homeomorphism on $X$ the spectrum of $A$, i.e. a homomorphism of semigroup  
\[\alpha: N_B(A) \rightarrow SHomeo(X).\] 

If $n\in N_B(A)$ and $x\in Spec(A)$, set 
\[\langle \alpha_n(x) , a\rangle =\langle x , n^*a n\rangle .\]
This defines a homeomorphism 
\[\alpha_n : U_n \rightarrow U_{n^*},\]
where $U_n = \{x\in Spec(A), n^*n(x) >0\}$ such that $\alpha_{nm} =\alpha_{n} \circ \alpha_{m}$.\\
 
If $A$ is maximal abelian in $B$, and other conditions, then $B$ is shown to be isomorphic to the twisted reduced $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid of stalks of $N_B(A)$. This can be seen  as an extension of the Gelfand transform
\[\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
B & \rightarrow & C^*_r(G) \\
b & \mapsto &  \\
\end{array}\right.\] 

\subsection{Classification and the UCT}

For $A$ a simple unital $C^*$-algebra, the Elliot invariant is:
\[Ell(A) = \left( K_0(A), K_0(A)_+ , [1_A]_0 , K_1(A), T(A) , r_A : T(A) \rightarrow S(K_0(A)) \right) ,\]
here $T(A)$ is the trace space and $r_A$ the paring $r_A(\tau)([p]) = [\tau(p)]$.\\

\textbf{Elliot's conjecture:} Separable, simple, nuclear are classifiable by Elliot's invariants.

\begin{thm}
Separable, simple, unital, nuclear, $\mathcal Z$-stable, UCT algebras are classifiable by Elliot's invariants.
\end{thm}

An example of a classification theorem: Elliot's theorem,

\begin{thm}
Let $A$ and $B$ unital AF-algebras and \[\alpha : K_0(A) \rightarrow K_1(A)\]
a unital order isomorphism, i.e. \[\alpha(K_0(A)_+) \subseteq K_0(B)_+ \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha([1_A])=[1_B].\]
Then there exists a unital $*$-isomorphism $\phi; A\rightarrow B$ such that $\phi_*=\alpha$.
\end{thm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{$C^*$-algebras}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] CAR algebra $C^*\langle a_i , a_i a_j +a_j a_i = \delta_{ij} \rangle $ or $\bigotimes M_2(\C)$ or 
\[\varinjlim \ 
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 
M_{2^n}(\C) & \rightarrow & M_{2^{n+1}}(\C) \\ 
a           & \mapsto     & \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a\end{pmatrix}\end{array}\right.\]
\end{itemize}

Class of $C^*$-algebras.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] The bootstrap class $\mathcal B$ \\
\item[$\bullet$] The class $\mathcal N$ of $C^*$-algebras $A$ such that the map 
\[\alpha_{A,B}: K_*(A)\otimes K_*(B) \rightarrow K_*(A \otimes B)\]
is an isomorphism for every $C^*$-algebra $B$ such that $K_*(B)$ is a free abelian group. In \cite{schochetRosenberg}, it is shown that $\mathcal N$ contains all of the bootstrap class.\\
\item[$\bullet$] Non exact $C^*$-algebra: to my knowledge only one example is known: the reduced $C^*$-algebra $C_r^*(\Gamma) $ of a finitely generated group whose Cayley graph contains expander. Using Ozawa's result \cite{Ozawa}, one can construct finite dimensional $C^*$-algebras $M_{X_n}$ such that 
\[ 0 \rightarrow C_r^*(\Gamma) \otimes \bigoplus M_{X_n} \rightarrow C_r^*(\Gamma) \otimes \prod M_{X_n} \rightarrow C_r^*(\Gamma) \otimes \left(\prod M_{X_n} /  \bigoplus M_{X_n} \right) \rightarrow 0\] is not exact in the middle.\\ The problem of the existence of such a group is an interesting question, which was stated by Gromov and proved rigorously by several people in the wake of this.\\	
\end{itemize}

One can define analog of approximation properties in the setting of $K$-theory. \\

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $A$ is $K$-nuclear if the class of the natural map
\[ p_{A,B} : A\otimes_{max} B \rightarrow A\otimes_{min} B \]
is invertible as an element of $KK(A\otimes_{max} B,A\otimes_{min} B)$.\\
\item[$\bullet$] $G$ is $K$-amenable if the class of the regular representation
\[ \lambda_{G} : C_{max}^*(G) \rightarrow C_{r}^*(G) \]
is invertible as an element of $KK(C_{max}^*(G),C_{r}^*(G))$.\\
\end{itemize}

For instance, Skandalis proves in \cite{SkandalisNotion} that, if $\Lambda$ is an infinite hyperbolic property T group, then $C_r^*(\Lambda)$ is not $K$-nuclear. In particular, it is not $KK$-equivalent to a nuclear $C^*$-algebra, and cannot be Bootstrap. This completely renders proving the Baum-Connes conjecture by mean of Dirac-Dual-Dirac method hopeless. An example of such a group is given by any lattice in $Sp(n,1)$ for instance. (higher rank algebraic semisimple groups?) \\

After developing a restriction principle for groupoids, a natural question was to find a $C^*$-algebra coming from a groupoid crossed-product that we were able to prove that it satisfied the Künneth formula, while still not being a consequence of previous results. One could have started with the so called HLS groupoid $G_{\mathcal N}(\Gamma)$ associated to a residually finite finitely generated group $\Gamma$ and a nested sequence of decreasing  normal sugroups of finite index $\mathcal N$.\\

One always has the following exact sequence of $*$-algebras
\[ 0 \rightarrow \oplus \C[\Gamma_n] \rightarrow C_c(G) \rightarrow \C [\Gamma]  \rightarrow 0\]      
which induces the following exact sequence of $C^*$-algebras
\[ 0 \rightarrow \oplus \C[\Gamma_n] \rightarrow C_r^*(G) \rightarrow C^*_{\mathcal N} (\Gamma)  \rightarrow 0\]   
where $C^*_{\matcal N}(\Gamma)$ is the completion of $\C[\Gamma]$ w.r.t. to the norm
\[||x||_{\mathcal N} = \sup_{N\in \mathcal N} ||\lambda_{N} (x)||\quad x\in \C[\Gamma] \]
induced by the quasi-regular representations $\lambda_{N} : C_{max}^*(\Gamma) \rightarrow \mathcal L(l^2(\Gamma/ N))$.  \\ 

Now this exact sequence intertwines the Baum-Connes assembly maps, and the Baum-Connes conjecture for $G_{\mathcal N}(\Gamma)$ is equivalent to $\mu_{\Gamma,\mathcal N}$ being an isomorphism. \\

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] If $\Gamma= \mathbb F_2$ and 
\[N_n = \cap ker \phi \]
for $\phi$ running accross all group homomorphisms from $\Gamma$ to a finite group of cardinality less than $n$, then $C_{\mathcal N}^*(\Gamma) \cong C_{max}^*(\Gamma)$ and $G$ satifies the Baum-Connes conjecture, is ample and satisfies the restriction condition. So we get that $C_r^*(G)$ satisfies the Künneth formula. It is still a result that one can get using the fact that $\Gamma$ being a-T-menable, it is $K$-amenable. Hence $C^*_{max}(\Gamma)$ and $C_r^*(\Gamma)$ are $KK$-equivalent and bootstrap, so that $C_r^*(G)$ also is by extension stability of bootstrapness. A remark of R. Willett is woth mentioning: $\mathbb F_2$ being the fundamental group of the wedge of two circles, it is $KK$-equivalent to $C(\mathbb S^1 \wedge \mathbb S^1)$.\\
\item[$\bullet$] One can artificially try to get rid of bootstrapiness by spatially tensoring this exact sequence by $C_r^*(\Lambda)$ for a infinite hyperbolic property T group. One then get the extension
\[ 0 \rightarrow \oplus \C[\Gamma_n] \otimes_{min} C_r^*(\Lambda) \rightarrow C_r^*(G\times \Lambda) \rightarrow C^*_{\mathcal N} (\Gamma)\otimes_{min} C_r^*(\Lambda)   \rightarrow 0.\]
The restriction principle applies for the groupoid $G_{\mathcal N}(\Gamma)\times\Lambda$, and induces that its reduced $C^*$-algebra satisfies the Künneth formula. But then again, one can deduce this from a previous result, namely the restriction principle for groups. Indeed, apply it to $\Lambda$ with coefficient on the trivial bootstrap $\Lambda$-algebra $C_r^*(G)$.	\\ 
\item[$\bullet$] Bekka shows that ??

\subsection{Why $SU_q(2)$?}

Apparently, some people are interested in deformation of classical Lie groups such as $SU_q(2)$, which is the Hopf algebra generated by $3$ generators $E,F,K$ satisfying the relations 
\[R.\]

I wanted to understand where these relations are coming from, which led me to interesting ideas developed by several people, including Yuri Manin. The idea is to define $SU_q(2)$ as a special group like object of the automorphism group of some noncommutative space, the quantum plane.\\

Let $k$ be a field. The free (noncommutative) $k$-algebra on $n$ generators is denoted by $k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle$.

\begin{definition}
A quadratic algebra 
\[A= \oplus_{i\geq 0} A_i\] 
is a $\N$-graded finitely generated algebra such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $A_0 = k$, and $A_1$ generates $A$,
\item[$\bullet$] the relations on generators are in $A_1 \otimes A_1$. 
\end{itemize} 
The quadratic algebra $A$ is said to be a Frobenius algebra of dimension $d$ if moreover 
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $A_d= k$ and $A_i =0$ for all $i>d$,
\item[$\bullet$] the multiplication map
\[m : A_i \otimes A_{d-i} \rightarrow A_d\]
is a perfect duality.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The main example is the quantum plane
\[\mathbb A_q^{2} = k\langle x,y \rangle / (xy -qyx)\]
where $q\in k^\times$. More generally, the quantum space of dimension $n|m$ is
\[ \mathbb A_q^{n|m} = k\langle x_1,.. ,x_n , \eta_1,...,\eta_m \rangle / (x_i x_j - q x_j x_i , q \eta_i \eta_j +  \eta_j \eta_i).\]
This example is suppose to come from physics. In quantum field theories, physicists deal with two kind of particles, bosons and fermions, and use commuting variables for one type, and anticommuting for the other. One object they appeal to are called supermanifolds, which are manifolds enriched with anticommuting variables. Formally, it means they look at ringed spaces $(X,\mathcal O)$ locally isomorphic to $(\R^n, C^\infty [\eta_1,...,\eta_m])$, where $C^\infty [\eta_1,...,\eta_m]$ is the free sheaf of rings generated by anticommuting variables $\eta_i$ over the smooth complex valued functions $C^\infty(\R^n)$.\\

Remark that a quadratic algebra $A$ is a quotient of $k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle$ by elements $r_\alpha \in A_1 \otimes A_1$, which we will denote as 
\[A= k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle / (r_\alpha)\]
or \[A= \langle A_1, R_A\rangle\]
with $R_A \subseteq A_1 \otimes A_1$.\\

Manin defines the quantum dual of a quadratic algebra as
\[A^{!} = k\langle x^i\rangle / (r^\beta)\]
where $r^\beta_{ij}r^{ij}_\alpha = 0$, i.e. $R_{A^!}=R_{A}^\perp$. Then, the quantum endormorphisms between two quadratic algebra is
\[Hom(A,B) =k\langle z^j_i\rangle / (r_\alpha^\beta)\]
where $r_\alpha^\beta = r_\alpha^{ij}r^\beta_{kl} z_i^k z_j^l$. If $End(A)= Hom(A,A)$, then $End(A)$ satisfies the universal property to be intial in the category of $k$-algebras $(B,\beta)$ endowed with an algebra homomorphism $\beta: A \rightarrow A\otimes B$.\\ 

If one does that to the quantum plane $\mathbb A_q^2$, one stil doesn't find quite $M_q(2)$: half of the relations are missing. Also 
\[(\mathbb A_q^{2|0})^! = \mathbb A_q^{0|2}?\] Exercise.

\subsection{TQFT}

We recalled the definitions of a monoidal category, a braided category, and a symmetric monoidal category. The two main examples are the category of bordisms $Bord^d$ in dimension $d$, and the category of vector spaces over a field $k$. The first talk focused on topological quantum fields theories in dimension $1$ and $2$.


\begin{definition} A TQFT in dimension $d$ is a monoidal symmetric functor
\[Z : Bord_d \rightarrow Vect_k.\] 
\end{definition}

The two main results we showed are:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] there is an equivalence of categories 
\[TQFT_1 \cong Vect_k \]
obtained as $Z \mapsto Z(pt)$.
\item[$\bullet$] there is an equivalence of categories 
\[TQFT_2 \cong Frob_k  \]
obtained as $Z \mapsto Z(\mathbb S^1)$.\\
\end{itemize}

A nice example in dimension $2$: $Z(\mathbb S^1)=\C [t]/ (t^2 -1 )$ is the Frobenius algebra given by
\[\Delta(t) = 1\otimes t + t\otimes 1 \quad \epsilon(1)=0 \quad \epsilon (t) =1.\]
Then the handle element is $h=2t$ and
\[ Z(\Sigma_g) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
2^g & \text{if }g\text{ is odd} \\
0 & \text{if }g\text{ is even.}
\end{array}\right.\]  

The second talk was directed towards extended field theories. First recall some higher category theory: $n$-categories, etc... And an extented TFT is a symmetric monoidal functor between symmetric monoidal $n$-categories
\[Z : Cob_n \rightarrow \mathcal C.\]

Then the following theorem was proved in \cite{Lurie}.

\begin{thm}
The evaluation functor \[ Z \mapsto Z(*)\] establishes a bijective correspondance between extended $n$-dimensional TFT and fully dualizable objects of $\mathcal C$. 
\end{thm}

We now give an application of this result to the Jones polynomial. In \cite{WittenJones}, Witten gives an interpretation of the Jones polynomial, an isotopy invariant of links, as induced from a $3$-dimensional TFT. The drawback of this article (for us) is that Witten uses Physical TFT's, i.e. gauge theories. The Jones polynmial is then shown to be the value of the partition function of a gauge field theory on $\mathbb S^3$ with gauge group $SU(2)$. I propose to rewrite this result in our setting as an exercise. \\  

A link is a disjoint union of embedding of the circle into $\mathbb S^3$
\[\mathcal L = \{ \text{embeddings }\coprod_{i=1}^k \mathbb S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb S^3 \}.\]
we will often make no distinction between the embedding and its image in the $3$-sphere, which we will denote by $L$. The Jones polynomial of a link $L$ is defined as an isotopy invariant polynomial $V : \mathcal L \rightarrow \Z [t^{\frac{1}{2}},t^{-\frac{1}{2}}]$ satisfying the Skein relations
\[-t^{\frac{1}{2}} V_+ + (t^{\frac{1}{2}} - t^{-\frac{1}{2}})V_0 + t^{-\frac{1}{2}}V_- = 0.\]
To a link $L$ one can associated the $3$-manifold $M_L= \mathbb S^3 - L$. Consider the extended TFT 
\[ Z^{(n)} : Cob_{3} \rightarrow \mathcal C\] given by $Z()=V_n$ where is the fundamental representation of $\mathfrak{su}(n)$. By the cobordism theorem, it is enough to define the TFT on all of $Cob_3$. Then
\[ \phi(V_L) = Z^{(2)}(M_L),\]
where $\phi : \Z [t^{\frac{1}{2}},t^{-\frac{1}{2}}] \rightarrow \C$ is the evaluation at a root of unity $q\in \C^\times$. This can be proved by showing that $Z^{(n)}(M_L)$ satisfies the skein relation \[-q^{\frac{n}{2}} V_+ + (q^{\frac{1}{2}} - q^{-\frac{1}{2}})V_0 + q^{-\frac{n}{2}}V_- = 0\]

\subsection{Reminder}

A locally ringed space is a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf or ring $\mathcal O_X$ over $X$ such that all stalks are local rings, ie have a unique maximal ideal.\\

For $R$ a ring, $X=Spec(R)$ denotes the topological space obtained as the set of prime ideals of $R$ endowed with the Zariski topology, i.e. the topology generated by the closed subsets
\[V_I = \{J \text{ ideals in } R \text{ s.t. } I \subset J \}.\]
Equivalently, a basis of open subsets is given by \[D_f = \{ J \text{ ideals in } R \text{ s.t. } f\notin J  \}\]
for every $f\in R$. Let $S_f$ be the multiplicative domain given by the powers of $f$. Then define a sheaf of ring over $X$ by
\[\mathcal O_X(D_f)   = S_f^{-1}R.\]
It is called the structural sheaf of $Spec(R)$. Any locally ringed space isomorphic to 
\[(Spec(R),\mathcal O_{Spec(R)})\] 
with $R$ commutative is called an affine variety.\\

Note: the functor $Spec$ gives an antiequivalence of categories between the categories of commutative rings and the category of affine varieties. 

\begin{definition}
A scheme is a locally ringed space locally isomorphic to an affine variety.
\end{definition}

\section{Langlands}

A modular form of weight $k$ is a section of 
\[\Lambda^{k+2}T^*M.\]
The projective space of the $\N$-graded algebra \[A=\bigoplus \Lambda^{k+2}T^*M\] is the compactification of the modular curve
\[\mathbb P(A) \cong \tilde{\mathcal C}.\]
If $F=\mathbb Q$ and $G= GL_2$, the finite part of the adele
\[\mathbb A_f = \prod_{\text{finite places}} F_\nu = \prod_{p \in \mathcal P} \mathbb Q_p\]
is ?? and $G(\hat{\Z})$ is the maximal compact of $G(\mathbb A_f)$ with $G(\mathbb A_f ) / G(\hat \Z)$ being two copies of the upper half plane $\mathbb H$, and $G(\mathbb A_\infty) \backslash G(\mathbb A) / G(K)$ is the modular curve.\\

Is the right part $G(\mathbb A_f)/ G(K)$ is isomorphic to the inductive limit $G(\Z / p^k \Z)$ ?\\

Yes if $G= GL_1$: \[ \varinjlim \Z / p^k \Z = \mathbb Q_p / \Z_p.\]

\section{Haagerup property, cocycles and the mapping class group}

If $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented connected surface (with marked points), we denote by $Mod(\Sigma)$ its so-called mapping class group.\\

In \cite{CostantinoMartelli} are used bounded representations of the mapping class group parametrized by a complex number $z\in \mathbb D$:
\[\pi_z : \Gamma \rightarrow \mathcal L(H).\]
Here, $H$ is the Hilbert space obtained as the free Hilbert space generated by multicurves having a finite number of intersections with a fixed triangulation $\tau$ of $\Sigma$.
