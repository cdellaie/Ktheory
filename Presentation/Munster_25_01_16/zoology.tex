\section{Seminar}

\subsection{Cartan subalgebras}

Out of any inclusion of $C^*$-algebras $A\subseteq B$ with $A$ unital commutative, we construct an action of the normalizer of $A$ in $B$ by partial homeomorphism on $X$ the spectrum of $A$, i.e. a homomorphism of semigroup  
\[\alpha: N_B(A) \rightarrow SHomeo(X).\] 

If $n\in N_B(A)$ and $x\in Spec(A)$, set 
\[\langle \alpha_n(x) , a\rangle =\langle x , n^*a n\rangle .\]
This defines a homeomorphism 
\[\alpha_n : U_n \rightarrow U_{n^*},\]
where $U_n = \{x\in Spec(A), n^*n(x) >0\}$ such that $\alpha_{nm} =\alpha_{n} \circ \alpha_{m}$.\\
 
If $A$ is maximal abelian in $B$, and other conditions, then $B$ is shown to be isomorphic to the twisted reduced $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid of stalks of $N_B(A)$. This can be seen  as an extension of the Gelfand transform
\[\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
B & \rightarrow & C^*_r(G) \\
b & \mapsto &  \\
\end{array}\right.\] 

\subsection{Classification and the UCT}

For $A$ a simple unital $C^*$-algebra, the Elliot invariant is:
\[Ell(A) = \left( K_0(A), K_0(A)_+ , [1_A]_0 , K_1(A), T(A) , r_A : T(A) \rightarrow S(K_0(A)) \right) ,\]
here $T(A)$ is the trace space and $r_A$ the paring $r_A(\tau)([p]) = [\tau(p)]$.\\

\textbf{Elliot's conjecture:} Separable, simple, nuclear are classifiable by Elliot's invariants.

\begin{thm}
Separable, simple, unital, nuclear, $\mathcal Z$-stable, UCT algebras are classifiable by Elliot's invariants.
\end{thm}

An example of a classification theorem: Elliot's theorem,

\begin{thm}
Let $A$ and $B$ unital AF-algebras and \[\alpha : K_0(A) \rightarrow K_1(A)\]
a unital order isomorphism, i.e. \[\alpha(K_0(A)_+) \subseteq K_0(B)_+ \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha([1_A])=[1_B].\]
Then there exists a unital $*$-isomorphism $\phi; A\rightarrow B$ such that $\phi_*=\alpha$.
\end{thm}

\[\varinjlim \ 
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 
M_{2^n}(\C) & \rightarrow & M_{2^{n+1}}(\C) \\ 
a           & \mapsto     & \begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a\end{pmatrix}\end{array}\right.\]
\end{itemize}


\section{Noncommutative geometry}

\subsection{Why $SU_q(2)$?}

Apparently, some people are interested in deformation of classical Lie groups such as $SU_q(2)$, which is the Hopf algebra generated by $3$ generators $E,F,K$ satisfying the relations 
\[R.\]

I wanted to understand where these relations are coming from, which led me to interesting ideas developed by several people, including Yuri Manin. The idea is to define $SU_q(2)$ as a special group like object of the automorphism group of some noncommutative space, the quantum plane.\\

Let $k$ be a field. The free (noncommutative) $k$-algebra on $n$ generators is denoted by $k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle$.

\begin{definition}
A quadratic algebra 
\[A= \oplus_{i\geq 0} A_i\] 
is a $\N$-graded finitely generated algebra such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $A_0 = k$, and $A_1$ generates $A$,
\item[$\bullet$] the relations on generators are in $A_1 \otimes A_1$. 
\end{itemize} 
The quadratic algebra $A$ is said to be a Frobenius algebra of dimension $d$ if moreover 
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] $A_d= k$ and $A_i =0$ for all $i>d$,
\item[$\bullet$] the multiplication map
\[m : A_i \otimes A_{d-i} \rightarrow A_d\]
is a perfect duality.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The main example is the quantum plane
\[\mathbb A_q^{2} = k\langle x,y \rangle / (xy -qyx)\]
where $q\in k^\times$. More generally, the quantum space of dimension $n|m$ is
\[ \mathbb A_q^{n|m} = k\langle x_1,.. ,x_n , \eta_1,...,\eta_m \rangle / (x_i x_j - q x_j x_i , q \eta_i \eta_j +  \eta_j \eta_i).\]
This example is suppose to come from physics. In quantum field theories, physicists deal with two kind of particles, bosons and fermions, and use commuting variables for one type, and anticommuting for the other. One object they appeal to are called supermanifolds, which are manifolds enriched with anticommuting variables. Formally, it means they look at ringed spaces $(X,\mathcal O)$ locally isomorphic to $(\R^n, C^\infty [\eta_1,...,\eta_m])$, where $C^\infty [\eta_1,...,\eta_m]$ is the free sheaf of rings generated by anticommuting variables $\eta_i$ over the smooth complex valued functions $C^\infty(\R^n)$.\\

Remark that a quadratic algebra $A$ is a quotient of $k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle$ by elements $r_\alpha \in A_1 \otimes A_1$, which we will denote as 
\[A= k\langle x_1,... ,x_n\rangle / (r_\alpha)\]
or \[A= \langle A_1, R_A\rangle\]
with $R_A \subseteq A_1 \otimes A_1$.\\

Manin defines the quantum dual of a quadratic algebra as
\[A^{!} = k\langle x^i\rangle / (r^\beta)\]
where $r^\beta_{ij}r^{ij}_\alpha = 0$, i.e. $R_{A^!}=R_{A}^\perp$. Then, the quantum endormorphisms between two quadratic algebra is
\[Hom(A,B) =k\langle z^j_i\rangle / (r_\alpha^\beta)\]
where $r_\alpha^\beta = r_\alpha^{ij}r^\beta_{kl} z_i^k z_j^l$. If $End(A)= Hom(A,A)$, then $End(A)$ satisfies the universal property to be intial in the category of $k$-algebras $(B,\beta)$ endowed with an algebra homomorphism $\beta: A \rightarrow A\otimes B$.\\ 

If one does that to the quantum plane $\mathbb A_q^2$, one stil doesn't find quite $M_q(2)$: half of the relations are missing. Also 
\[(\mathbb A_q^{2|0})^! = \mathbb A_q^{0|2}?\] Exercise.

\subsection{TQFT}

We recalled the definitions of a monoidal category, a braided category, and a symmetric monoidal category. The two main examples are the category of bordisms $Bord^d$ in dimension $d$, and the category of vector spaces over a field $k$. The first talk focused on topological quantum fields theories in dimension $1$ and $2$.


\begin{definition} A TQFT in dimension $d$ is a monoidal symmetric functor
\[Z : Bord_d \rightarrow Vect_k.\] 
\end{definition}

The two main results we showed are:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] there is an equivalence of categories 
\[TQFT_1 \cong Vect_k \]
obtained as $Z \mapsto Z(pt)$.
\item[$\bullet$] there is an equivalence of categories 
\[TQFT_2 \cong Frob_k  \]
obtained as $Z \mapsto Z(\mathbb S^1)$.\\
\end{itemize}

A nice example in dimension $2$: $Z(\mathbb S^1)=\C [t]/ (t^2 -1 )$ is the Frobenius algebra given by
\[\Delta(t) = 1\otimes t + t\otimes 1 \quad \epsilon(1)=0 \quad \epsilon (t) =1.\]
Then the handle element is $h=2t$ and
\[ Z(\Sigma_g) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 
2^g & \text{if }g\text{ is odd} \\
0 & \text{if }g\text{ is even.}
\end{array}\right.\]  

\subsection{Reminder}

A locally ringed space is a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf or ring $\mathcal O_X$ over $X$ such that all stalks are local rings, ie have a unique maximal ideal.\\

For $R$ a ring, $X=Spec(R)$ denotes the topological space obtained as the set of prime ideals of $R$ endowed with the Zariski topology, i.e. the topology generated by the closed subsets
\[V_I = \{J \text{ ideals in } R \text{ s.t. } I \subset J \}.\]
Equivalently, a basis of open subsets is given by \[D_f = \{ J \text{ ideals in } R \text{ s.t. } f\notin J  \}\]
for every $f\in R$. Let $S_f$ be the multiplicative domain given by the powers of $f$. Then define a sheaf of ring over $X$ by
\[\mathcal O_X(D_f)   = S_f^{-1}R.\]
It is called the structural sheaf of $Spec(R)$. Any locally ringed space isomorphic to 
\[(Spec(R),\mathcal O_{Spec(R)})\] 
with $R$ commutative is called an affine variety.\\

Note: the functor $Spec$ gives an antiequivalence of categories between the categories of commutative rings and the category of affine varieties. 

\begin{definition}
A scheme is a locally ringed space locally isomorphic to an affine variety.
\end{definition}

\section{Langlands}

A modular form of weight $k$ is a section of 
\[\Lambda^{k+2}T^*M.\]
The projective space of the $\N$-graded algebra \[A=\bigoplus \Lambda^{k+2}T^*M\] is the compactification of the modular curve
\[\mathbb P(A) \cong \tilde{\mathcal C}.\]
If $F=\mathbb Q$ and $G= GL_2$, the finite part of the adele
\[\mathbb A_f = \prod_{\text{finite places}} F_\nu = \prod_{p \in \mathcal P} \mathbb Q_p\]
is ?? and $G(\hat{\Z})$ is the maximal compact of $G(\mathbb A_f)$ with $G(\mathbb A_f ) / G(\hat \Z)$ being two copies of the upper half plane $\mathbb H$, and $G(\mathbb A_\infty) \backslash G(\mathbb A) / G(K)$ is the modular curve.\\

Is the right part $G(\mathbb A_f)/ G(K)$ is isomorphic to the inductive limit $G(\Z / p^k \Z)$ ?\\

Yes if $G= GL_1$: \[ \varinjlim \Z / p^k \Z = \mathbb Q_p / \Z_p.\]
