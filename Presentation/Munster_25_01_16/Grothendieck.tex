\section{Grothendieck and tensor products, the origin of nuclearity}

This section is based on a talk given by Gilles Pisier, and his (exceptionally good) survey article.\\

Grothendieck started his work in functional analysis. While this is well known, I wanted to write a little post about how his work is important in my field. \\

Grothendieck did his Licence (his "undergrad") in the south of France, in the city of Montpellier. 

If $x= \sum_j \alpha_j \otimes \beta_j$,
\[|| x ||_\wedge  = \inf \{ || \alpha_j || \ || \beta_j || : x=\sum_j \alpha_j \otimes \beta_j\}\]
and
\[|| x ||_\wedge  = \sup \{ || \alpha_j || \ || \beta_j || : x=\sum_j \alpha_j \otimes \beta_j\}\]
and
\[|| x ||_H  = \inf \{ || \alpha_j || \ || \beta_j || : x=\sum_j \alpha_j \otimes \beta_j\}\]
